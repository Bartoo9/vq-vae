# VQ-VAE

This repository implements a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), a type of generative model that combines variational autoencoding with discrete latent representations. VQ-VAEs are effective for learning discrete representations and have applications in image, audio, and sequence modeling.

## Features

- PyTorch implementation of VQ-VAE architecture
- Configurable encoder and decoder networks
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Example usage and configuration files
